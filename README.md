# to do

## bugs

improve Title, todo and refresh.hover CSS

Have date bottom header rather than absolute bottom

completed opacity is changed when loading from local storage but not with current session and does not reverse


## future

Create filtering classes

add week number?

create daily, weekly, monthly divs
