-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are purple and white to have a high contrast, low eyes strain application.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Poppins is a simple font that is appealing for this purpose.

        -   No images were used for this project to keep the simple and neutral effect desired.

        3. Once the first item is added, the 2 buttons next to the item have the same visual to create consistancy to the user
        4. When the user complete a task, the opacity is reduce and the text is barred

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be see a visually compellent design and animations.
